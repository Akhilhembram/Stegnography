# Steganography Tool

This project is a simple **Image Steganography application** built with **Python**, using **OpenCV** for image processing and **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface. It allows users to securely hide secret messages inside image files using **XOR encryption** based on a user-defined key. The same key is required to decrypt and retrieve the hidden message.
